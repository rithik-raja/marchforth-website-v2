## Overview

Gathr needed a dependable student engagement system that worked for both students and campus administrators. Existing workflows were fragmented across group chats, social posts, and disconnected tools, making event discovery and attendance tracking inconsistent.

MarchForth helped shape a unified product experience: a mobile app for students and a management dashboard for campus teams. The goal was simple and practical: reduce friction, increase participation, and provide operational visibility.
