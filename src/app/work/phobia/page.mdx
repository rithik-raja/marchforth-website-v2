## Executive summary

MyTempie is a mobile-first health solution designed to capture user body temperature through an external IR sensor and synchronize that data to AWS for enterprise safety monitoring.

MarchForth delivered the full product stack: sensor integration, cross-platform mobile app, administrative dashboard, APIs, and cloud infrastructure.

## The challenge

At project start, organizations needed fast, non-contact temperature screening that could scale without manual bottlenecks.

The program had three key constraints:

1. Hardware integration: mobile devices had to reliably ingest readings from Melexis MLX90614/90632 sensors through Arduino ESP32 over I2C.
2. Data integrity: each reading needed secure linkage to authenticated user identities for compliance and auditability.
3. Scalability: the platform needed to support bulk user operations and multiple organizational datasets in parallel.

## The solution

MarchForth implemented a production-ready architecture across hardware, software, and cloud layers.

## Workflow

1. Authenticated users open the MyTempie mobile app.
2. The app captures identity context and triggers the IR sensor for a reading.
3. If temperature is below the configured threshold, access is approved; otherwise, entry is restricted.
4. Temperature and user metadata are sent to AWS in real time for centralized review.
5. Administrators monitor logs and manage bulk user data through the dashboard.
